    "# Manipulating Files and Directories\n",
    "This chapter is a brief introduction to the Unix shell. You'll learn why it is still in use after almost 50 years, how it compares to the graphical tools you may be more familiar with, how to move around in the shell, and how to create, modify, and delete files and folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does the shell compare to the desk interface?\n",
    "- Humans need an **interface** to interact with an operating system (whether it be Windows, Linux, or Mac OS)\n",
    "- Most common one is a graphical file explorer\n",
    "    - Translates clicks and double-clicks into commands to open files and run programs\n",
    "- Before computers had graphical displays, though, people typed instructions into a program called a **command-line shell**\n",
    "    - Command is entered $\\rightarrow$ the shell runs some other programs $\\rightarrow$ prints their output in human-readable form $\\rightarrow$ displays a *prompt* to signal that it's ready to accept the next command\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where am I?\n",
    "- The **filesystem** manages files and directories (or folders)\n",
    "- Each is identified by an **absolute path**\n",
    "    - **Absolute path**: shows how to reach a file from the filesystem's **root directory**\n",
    "- To find out where you are in the filesystem, run `pwd`\n",
    "    - Short for **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory\n",
    "- This prints the absolute path of your **current working directory**\n",
    "    - which is where the shell runs commands and looks for files by default\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I identify files and directories?\n",
    "- `pwd` tells you where you are\n",
    "- To find out what's there type `ls`\n",
    "    - Short for **l**i**s**ting\n",
    "- On its own, `ls` lists contents of your current directory\n",
    "- If you add names of files or directories, `ls` will list their contents\n",
    "\n",
    "## How else can I identify files and directories?\n",
    "- A **relative path** specifies a location from where you are\n",
    "- The shell decides if a path is absolute or relative by looking at its first character\n",
    "    - If it begins with `/` it is absolute\n",
    "    - If it *does not* begin with `/` it is relative\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I move to another directory?\n",
    "- Just as you can move around a file browser by double-clicking on folders, you can move around a filesystem using the command `cd`\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I move up a directory?\n",
    "- The **parent** of a directory is the directory above it\n",
    "    - E.g. `/home` is the parent of `/home/repl`\n",
    "- You can always give the absolute path of your parent directory to commands like `cd` and `ls`\n",
    "- Instead you may way to use the special path `..` which represents \"the directory above the one I'm currently in\"\n",
    "    - E.g. If you are in `/home/repl` then `cd ..` moves you up to `/home`\n",
    "- A single dot `.` always means \"current working directory\"\n",
    "- `~` means \"your home directory\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I copy files?\n",
    "- You will often want to copy files, move them into other directories to organize them, or rename them\n",
    "- `cp` does this, which is short for \"copy\"\n",
    "- If `original.txt` is an existing file, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "        cp original.txt duplicate.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "    creates a copy of `original.txt` called `duplicate.txt`. If there already was a file called `duplicate.txt`, it's overwritten   \n",
    "- If the last parameter to `cp` is an existing directory then a command like,\n",
    "\n",
    "        cp seasonal/autumn.csv seasonal/winter.csv backup\n",
    "\n",
    "    copies *all* files into that directory\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I move a file?\n",
    "- `mv` moves a file from one directory to another\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I rename files?\n",
    "- `mv` can also be used to rename files\n",
    "- If you run,\n",
    "\n",
    "        mv course.txt old-course.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "    then the file `course.txt` in the current working directory is \"moved\" to the file `old-course.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Warning: Just like `cp`, `mv` will overwrite existing files\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I delete files?\n",
    "- Use `rm`, which stands for \"remove\"\n",
    "- As with `cp`, you can give `rm` the names of as many files as you'd like\n",
    "- Unlike graphical file browsers, the shell doesn't have a trash can\n",
    "    - When you type the command, the file is gone for good\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I create and delete directories?\n",
    "- If you try `rm` the shell prints an error message to prevent you from deleting an entire directory\n",
    "- Instead you can use `rmdir`\n",
    "    - For added safety, it only work when the directory is empty\n",
    "    - You must delete its contents *before* you delete the directory\n",
    "    - Experienced users can use the `-r` option to `rm` to get the same effect\n",
    "- `mkdir directory_name` creates a new (empty) directory"
